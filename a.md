+271% more opt-ins (study)

How RocketMemory managed to increase their opt-ins by +271% without reducing number of form fields...

RocketMemory had low conversions for opt-ins: 5.15%
But they couldn't reduce the number of fields in their form.

They asked for:
+ First name
+ Email
+ Age
+ Gender
+ Are you a student: yes/no
+ Are you taking classes or studying for something? yes/no


After they made the following changes, their signup rate increased by 271% (more than triple!)

Here's what they did...
They split the flow into 4 micro-commitment steps:

Step #1: "Would you like to receive memory techniques specifically geared to what you're studying?": Yes/No

Step #2: "Are you a man or a woman?": 2 options

Step #3: "Which of the following describes you?": 4 options to choose from.

Step #4: "Where Should I Send Your Personalized Memory Tips?": input your name and email.

As you can see, they asked for the same info but in 4 different steps.

The result is amazing:
over 3 times more opt-ins.

How?

Have you heard of Gmail Ads?
The Gmail ad looks like a regular email in your inbox.

It means your ad targets people actively using email now - this is why it converts better into opt-ins.


How to activate this secret targeting?

1. When choosing how to target your ads,
click on “Use a different targeting method.”

2. Choose "Placements".

3. Search for Gmail and you’ll see it in the list.

4. Add “mail.google.com” from the list that populates.

5. Once you confirm the campaign, you’ll need to hit Ads -> + AD -> Ad gallery.

6. Choose Gmail Ads and fill in all fields.

P.S. Remember to confirm that your ad is formatted for the smaller screen and loads quickly, because 75% of Gmail users access their accounts from their mobile device.
