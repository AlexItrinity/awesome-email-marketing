+271% more opt-ins (study)

How RocketMemory managed to increase their opt-ins by +271% without reducing number of form fields...

RocketMemory had low conversions for opt-ins: 5.15%
But they couldn't reduce the number of fields in their form.

They asked for:
+ First name
+ Email
+ Age
+ Gender
+ Are you a student: yes/no
+ Are you taking classes or studying for something? yes/no


After they made the following changes, their signup rate increased by 271% (more than triple!)

Here's what they did...
They split the flow into 4 micro-commitment steps:

Step #1: "Would you like to receive memory techniques specifically geared to what you're studying?": Yes/No

Step #2: "Are you a man or a woman?": 2 options

Step #3: "Which of the following describes you?": 4 options to choose from.

Step #4: "Where Should I Send Your Personalized Memory Tips?": input your name and email.

As you can see, they asked for the same info but in 4 different steps.

The result is amazing:
over 3 times more opt-ins.

How?

Have you heard of Gmail Ads?
The Gmail ad looks like a regular email in your inbox.

It means your ad targets people actively using email now - this is why it converts better into opt-ins.


How to activate this secret targeting?

1. When choosing how to target your ads,
click on “Use a different targeting method.”

2. Choose "Placements".

3. Search for Gmail and you’ll see it in the list.

4. Add “mail.google.com” from the list that populates.

5. Once you confirm the campaign, you’ll need to hit Ads -> + AD -> Ad gallery.

6. Choose Gmail Ads and fill in all fields.

P.S. Remember to confirm that your ad is formatted for the smaller screen and loads quickly, because 75% of Gmail users access their accounts from their mobile device.

60% open rate for sales emails (Smart)

How this company achieved a 60% open rate for sales emails...

You want to convert your email subscribers into customers.
But you are afraid to lose them once you start selling.

This company was selling air conditioners.
They were also sending out weather forecasts daily through emails and text messages to their subscribers.

How do you think they decided to send sales emails to buy an air conditioner?

Only when the temperature crossed 75°F (24°C).

60% of those emails and close to 90% of the text messages were opened.

1,000 new subscribers in 60 hours (study)

This approach helped Sarah to get over 1,000 new subscribers in 60 hours with $0 spent

You’ve created an awesome article, it gained a bunch of shares and a good position on Google.
You invested a week to create it and 2 weeks to promote it.

Now the only way to grow more is to invest 3 more weeks into another epic article.
Right?

Wrong.

Sarah Peterson used a different approach, invested one day, and got over 1,000 new subscribers in 60 hours. All while spending $0.

The approach is called republishing.
Here's how you can apply it:

1. Find media that accepts republishing.
Here's a simple hack on how to do this fast:
Just Google:
YOUR_TOPIC "this article was originally published"

2. Send an email similar to this:
Subject: [Something eye-catching and not generic]
Body:
Hi [Editor name],

[Personal connection point]

I recently wrote an article about [topic] which my audience has enjoyed. I think [publication name’s] audience would love the article as well, because [why?].

I’ve included the article in the body of this email below, and if you’d rather check the original article out here is the link:

[link].

If you enjoy the article and think it would be a good fit, I would love to have it republished on [publication name].

Let me know what you think.

[Your name]


3. When your article gets accepted, ask to place a canonical tag to your original article (it helps Google to understand where the original article is):
<link rel="canonical" href="YOUR_URL_HERE">
